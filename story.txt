this is the story of a girl
who cried a river and drowned the whole world
and while she looks so sad in photographs
i absolutely love her
when she smiles

how many days in a year
she woke up with hope, but she only found tears
and i can be so insincere
making her promises never for real
as long as she stands there waiting
wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
how many days disappear
when you look in the mirror
so how do you choose
